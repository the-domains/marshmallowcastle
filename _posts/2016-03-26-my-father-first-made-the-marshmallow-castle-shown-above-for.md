My father first made the marshmallow castle shown above for my two sisters for Christmas in 1959\.  Since then, building marshmallow castles with our children has been a family tradition passed down to each generation.  The memories of building these castles are something that we cherish for a lifetime. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5a776714-d978-459b-8b0c-9b47316d433c.jpg)
